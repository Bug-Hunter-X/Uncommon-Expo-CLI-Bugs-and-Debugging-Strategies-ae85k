Debugging uncommon Expo CLI errors often requires a systematic approach:

1. **Thorough Log Analysis:** Examine both the Expo CLI's output and any system logs (on your device or emulator) for subtle clues.  The error might be indirectly indicated or hidden within verbose logs.
2. **Expo CLI Diagnostics:** Use the `expo diagnostics` command to check the health of your project setup.  This can identify compatibility issues or missing dependencies.
3. **Selective Code Elimination:** Gradually remove or comment out sections of your code to isolate the potential source of the error.  Try restarting the Expo Go app or development server after each change.
4. **Native Module Debugging:** If the issue involves native modules, using a debugger to step through native code might be necessary.  This is often more complex and requires additional tools.
5. **Community Support:** Seek help from the Expo community forums or GitHub issue tracker.  Describe the problem in detail, including any relevant error messages or system information.
6. **Project Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes a clean project rebuild can resolve subtle inconsistencies caused by cached files or intermediate build artifacts. Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling packages.
7. **Dependency Updates:** Ensure all your dependencies (including Expo itself) are up-to-date.  Outdated packages could be the root cause of many unforeseen issues. 

*Note:* The solution often involves careful observation and iterative debugging, rather than a single fix.  Be prepared to spend significant time on log analysis and systematic code investigation.
